# Movie Genre Classification using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project predicts the genre of a movie based on its description using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.

The model analyzes the movie plot/summary and classifies it into a genre such as Drama, Thriller, Comedy, etc.

##  Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* NLP (Text Preprocessing)
* TF-IDF Vectorization

##  Machine Learning Process

1. Data Cleaning (removing stopwords & noise)
2. Text Preprocessing
3. Feature Extraction using TF-IDF
4. Train-Test Split
5. Model Training (Multinomial Naive Bayes)
6. Model Evaluation

##  Model Accuracy

**Accuracy Achieved: ~52%**

(This dataset is complex and contains many genres, so moderate accuracy is expected.)
